"With an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, many multinational corporations (mncs) across the globe have made public commitments to net zero and have started developing long-term strategies for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. as mncs make large investments to meet their environmental and sustainability goals, transfer pricing issues are gaining prominence. transfer pricing represents the price that one related party in a company charges another related party for goods and services provided.  these prices/charges need to follow the “arm’s-length principle” – meaning that the amount charged by one related party to another for a given product must be the same as if the parties were not related.",Opportunity,positive
"In order to meet an overall carbon emissions reduction target, many mncs will need to purchase carbon credits from the open market and have a ct lead this effort. a key transfer pricing consideration is how to remunerate the ct for its administrative and agency activities. should it be remunerated based strictly on its total costs or should it be remunerated based on a discount/premium on the price of the carbon credits (with the service fee included in that discount/premium)? to the extent operating entities transfer carbon credits among related parties, there are transfer pricing questions regarding appropriate pricing. it is important to understand which entity bears the market risk for fluctuations in carbon price to ensure that the entity is appropriately remunerated. this can be particularly relevant when there is a multiyear lag between the acquisition of offset certificates and settlement date.",Risk,negative
"A company could consider a structure where a ct has more functions and greater responsibilities and works as a profit center by buying and selling carbon credits in the open market and earning related profits. in order to have robust transfer pricing support for this arrangement, the company should maintain transparent records so that there is a clear demarcation between income/loss generated from proprietary trading activity and income generated selling/sourcing surplus carbon credits for the operating entities. each service that the ct provides to the operating entities needs to be identified and compensated in a manner consistent with the arm’s length standard.",Opportunity,positive
